        <H1>About us</H1>
Han-bap was inspired from the Korean words (한국) and (밥), han refers to Korea, while bap refers to rice as rice is  the main dish in Korea, it is the center of the Korean table. And it is a blank state, its taste differs according to the side dish that comes with it. 
Korean people say that they live off the strength they get from rice and they greet each other by asking if they have eaten? Food is so important for Koreans and rice occupies a huge part of Koreans everyday lives. We aim to introduce more about Korean culture and its cuisine.
